# MSApriori

How to run:

1. Name the data file as 'input-data.txt'
2. Name the parameter file as 'parameter-file.txt'
3. Place the two files and main.py in one folder.
4. Run the main.py file using any IDE or native python interpreter.
5. The output will be printed on the console and written to 'outputFile.txt'


Constraints:
Implementation of Apriori algorithm with minimum support for each item.

1. The input and parameter files should be present in the same folder as this python file.
2. There are two input files required for the code to execute. Line 29 reads the input file. The input file should be named "input-data.txt".
3. Parameters are read from the parameter file named "parameter-file.txt". The file with the parameters will be recognized only if it is named as mentioned in the previous line.
3. On execution, the program prints the output on the console. It also writes the output to a file - "outputFile.txt". This file is created in the same folder as the python code.
4. If there are no frequent itemsets formed, the output will state that the count of the frequent-1 itemsets is zero.
